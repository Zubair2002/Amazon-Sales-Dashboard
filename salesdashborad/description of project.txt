Imported the dataset from Kaggle into Power BI.

Cleaned the data by fixing errors (removed invalid rows and replaced incorrect symbols).

Formatted columns (currency, text, numbers) for correct aggregations.

Data Modeling

Created new measures using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):

Total Sales = Sum of discounted_price.

Gross Margin % = Profitability estimate based on actual_price vs. discounted_price.

Sales with Growth = Dynamic ‚ÄúWhat If‚Äù measure to simulate sales growth scenarios.

Card visuals for KPIs (Total Sales, Gross Margin %, Product Count).

Column Chart showing Sales by Product Category.

Matrix/Table to compare categories, sales, and users.

‚ÄúWhat If‚Äù Analysis Slider ‚Üí lets users test different sales growth percentages and see impact dynamically.

Cohort Analysis Simulation (using User ID & product_category) to show new vs returning buyers by category.
